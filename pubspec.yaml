description: A new Flutter application.

  # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
  # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
  # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
  # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
  # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
  # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
  # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
  # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
